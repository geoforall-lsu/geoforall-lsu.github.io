Brendan gave a great presentation about how to use Python in GRASS GIS to batch-process rasters. The layers he uses are from periodic drone flights over LSU's Hilltop Arboretum, and you can see vegetation emerge from one image to the next. He also gives an overview of some basic Python syntax, including file path management and "for" loops.

You can follow along with this video on your own, just be sure to [install GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/) ahead of time, and go to [Brendan's website](https://baharmon.github.io/python-in-grass) to download the example data.

Note: Sorry about the sloppy start to the video! Skip ahead to 00:20.

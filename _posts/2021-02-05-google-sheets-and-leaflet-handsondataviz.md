Adam gave an overview of a mapping project he worked on at a hackathon for the
New Orleans Summit on Compassion and Resilience. To put together an interactive, crowdsourced map
of trauma support centers around the New Orleans area, the team utilized one of the templates
hosted at [HandsOnDataViz.org](http://HandsOnDataViz.org) - [Leaflet Maps with Google Sheets](https://handsondataviz.org/leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets.html). This presentation is an overview (including a bit of important troubleshooting and Q & A) of how that template works, and the advantages it brings along with it.

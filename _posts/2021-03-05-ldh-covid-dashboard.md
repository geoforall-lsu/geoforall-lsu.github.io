[Louisiana Coronavirus COVID-19 Operations Dashboard](https://www.ldh.la.gov/coronavirus/)

As the nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, Mr. Berens began to build a GIS dashboard to track reported cases by parish in Louisiana. Louisiana was among the first states to publish a COVID-19 dashboard. By mid-March 2020 the dashboard went live and was available to the public as a part of the state's goal of transparently providing information to both leadership and the public. Mr. Berens will discussed some of what has gone into creating and maintaining the dashboard that Louisianans rely on from everyday citizens to news outlets and government officials.

The presentation above begins with an introduction from John McEwen from the [LA chapter of SCAUG](https://www.scaug.org/Louisiana) (South Central Arc User Group), who originally connected us with Mr. Berens. We always welcome collaboration, so a big thank you to John, and to all the SCAUG members who showed up as well.

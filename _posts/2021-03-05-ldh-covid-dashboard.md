Louisiana Coronavirus COVID-19 Operations Dashboard

As the nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, Mr. Berens began to build a GIS dashboard to track reported cases by parish in Louisiana. Louisiana was among the first states to publish a COVID-19 dashboard. By mid-March 2020 the dashboard went live and was available to the public as a part of the state's goal of transparently providing information to both leadership and the public. Mr. Berens will discuss some of what has gone into creating and maintaining the dashboard that Louisianans rely on from everyday citizens to news outlets and government officials.

Mr. Berens will be present for the first portion of the hour, and plenty of time for questions and discussion will follow.

We started the year with introductions all around, and by taking a look back at the
[original presentation]({% post_url 2020-01-22-first-meeting %}) I had put together for our first meeting last semester.
Ideas that emerged from discussion:

- Having a table on Free Speech Alley at some point, and putting up flyers on campus
- Having some sort of presence/event/something for [GIS Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_Day) (looks like it's Wed. Nov. 18th)
- Presentation request from Andrew: Something about modeling wildfires!
- Brendan suggests more Open Street Map presentations, specifically one about
[Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) an initiative that supports OSM
mapping efforts for disaster relief.

In other news, we have plenty of people to fill our registered student organization
roster, but have room for another officer. If you are interested in helping to
manage some of the admin side of things, or plan events, just get in touch: acox42@lsu.edu.

Next Thursday Brendan will present about using Python to run operations in GRASS GIS.
He'll start with some introductory content about Python itself and then move into how
to script geospatial operations.

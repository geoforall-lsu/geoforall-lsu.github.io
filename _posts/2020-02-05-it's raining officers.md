Geo For All – LSU held its second meeting on Wednesday, February 5, in Design Building Room 308, and is well on its way to becoming a full-fledged student organization. Our official paperwork has been submitted, and we should hear back from the school within the next week. As discussed at our first meeting, we also have official officers:

- President: Adam Cox (G&A)
- Vice President: Tanvi Shah (LA)
- Treasurer: Betsy Peterson (LA)
- Secretary: Andrew Wright (LA)

We also have this flashy new website. Adam shared the website with the group and solicited feedback and suggestions for further development. The website has a number of great features, including forms to propose and request presentation topics and a resources page that will become a great source for all things open source GIS for the LSU community.

The group then brainstormed ideas for future presentation topics, including:

- Introduction to Github and Markdown
- Non-linear maps
- Wildlife Corridor Modeling
- Overview of geospatial programming (Spatial R, Python, etc.)

To submit a presentation proposal, you can use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8hBwptNZpw3Ay5_LVqi7TytayMjpwxVc02w_0iBMle6OSoQ/viewform) (also found on the [presentations](/presentations) page).

Our next meeting will take place on Wednesday, February 19 at 1 PM in Design Building Room 308, when Adam will give a presentation on Georeferencing Historic Maps with QGIS. Hope to see you there!

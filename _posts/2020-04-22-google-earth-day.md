We had a pretty informal chat where Andrew showed us EarthNow! Landsat Viewer, Adam
talked about a Cartographica article that describes the origins of Google Earth (["Sovereigns, Spooks, and Hackers"](https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/carto.48.4.1621)), and
Brendan gave a demo of Google Earth Engine.

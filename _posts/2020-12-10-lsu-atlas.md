If you have ever looked for LiDAR data in Louisiana, chances are you have
come across [Atlas](https://atlas.ga.lsu.edu/), a geospatial data portal
for the state of Louisiana which is hosted right here at LSU. Luke Driskell
of the Geography & Anthropology department
gives an overview of the history of the portal, which geospatial datasets
it serves (not only LiDAR), how to access the data, and even shows how the
whole thing is put together.

This presentation was a real treat. Thanks Luke!

We explored what it looks like to connect to an ArcGIS REST endpoint from QGIS, and Tanvi showed a real life example and how she encountered it (skip to 4:30 for this). Later we did some exploring, and found that all of the parcel and building footprint data (and much more) behind [St. John Parish Assessor's online GIS](https://atlas.geoportalmaps.com/stjohn_public) is available [here](https://services.geoportalmaps.com/arcgis/rest/services/StJohn_Public_Services/MapServer/)!

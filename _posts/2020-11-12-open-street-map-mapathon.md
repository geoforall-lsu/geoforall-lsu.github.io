We are hosting three mapathons this week! On Wednesday (9:30am-11:30am), Thursday (12:00pm-1:00pm, normal meeting time), and Friday (9:30am-11:30am). [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is like the Wikipedia version of Google Maps, and, fun fact, Open Street Map base data is the core of many, many web mapping applications out in the world.

At these events, we'll be working on a humanitarian mapping project like [this one in response to Super Typhoon Rolly](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/9780#description). All you need to do is sign up above, and we'll e-mail you the information to get started.

If you want to get a head start, create a free account on [Open Street Map](https://openstreetmap.org) and then watch videos 3 and 4 [here](https://www.missingmaps.org/learn/#beginner).

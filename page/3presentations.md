Anyone is welcome to present at our Wednesday meetings.

Just fill out the [presentation signup form](https://forms.gle/dKjcLWRzbwkfYVFz9){:target="_blank"}.

Alternatively, if there is a topic you would love to learn more about, you can suggest it with this [presentation suggestion form](https://forms.gle/ycK9bXo1nc3MY1vE7){:target="_blank"}.
